Bash 

Options modify the behavior of commands:
ls -a lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories
ls -l lists all contents in long format
ls -t orders files and directories by the time they were last modified
Multiple options can be used together, like ls -alt
From the command line, you can also copy, move, and remove files and directories:
cp copies files
mv moves and renames files
rm removes files
rm -r removes directories
Wildcards are useful for selecting groups of files and directories

Redirection reroutes standard input, standard output, and standard error.

The common redirection commands are:

> redirects standard output of a command to a file, overwriting previous content.
>> redirects standard output of a command to a file, appending new content to old content.
< redirects standard input to a command.
| redirects standard output of a command to another command.
A number of other commands are powerful when combined with redirection commands:

sort: sorts lines of text alphabetically.
uniq: filters duplicate, adjacent lines of text.
grep: searches for a text pattern and outputs it.
sed : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it.


export VARIABLE="Value" sets and exports an environment variable.
USER is the name of the current user.
PS1 is the command prompt.
HOME is the home directory. It is usually not customized.
PATH returns a colon : separated list of file paths. It is customized in advanced cases.
env returns a list of environment variables. You can redirect the output, using grep to select the variable you want to see.
